## How to Contribute as a Team Member

**Fork → Clone → Create _My_Feature_ Branch → Commit → Push → PR**

For Git Commands - [Git Learning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FV9Cnl3CyYi4dUOMgGdILIYHYvIetTWHpcDnNYWQpb0/edit?usp=sharing)

**Important** to keep the changes in _Sync with My_Repo_
- `git remote add upstream https://github.com/Adi-Modi-65/cdsr.git`
- `git pull --rebase upstream main` - _For all branches and commits from the original repo_
- `git push origin main` - _Push the Updated Main Branch to Your Forked GitHub Repo_
- Then make the **Pull Request** to **My_Repo**


Then run commands-
- `cd app`
- `npm install`
- `npm run android`

> [!Note]
> Everyone to use _JS_ initially and later we can move to _TypeScript_

**You can find everything in `src` folder**
